# Datathon Bootcamp with TIBCO Spotfire

Welcome to the DUC Datathon 2020 Intermediate Level Bootcamp for TIBCO Spotfire :bar_chart:! Follow along with this guide to learn about geoanalytics, data functions, property controls.


### Introduction

My name is Neil Kanungo, a Data Scientist with TIBCO Software. You might know me from [Dr. Spotfire](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/doctor-spotfire-office-hours) :grin:! If you haven't already, I highly recommend you subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3agqDZLbfrHNDUaxr0CXA) to get regular Spotfire video tips, and [register](https://www.tibco.com/events/dr-spotfire-office-hours) for one of our monthly live sessions. There's always tons to learn with TIBCO Spotfire and I aim to teach you all the newest tricks :cowboy_hat_face:

The bootcamp in this repo covers three (3) exercises to help intermediate users:

- Exercise 1 : Geospatial Analysis
- Exercise 2 : Machine Learning
- Exercise 3 : Styling Tips

You can find the files for each exercise in the "exercises" folder directory.


### Exercise 1: Geospatial Analysis

Data Functions:
- [Contour Plot](https://community.tibco.com/modules/map-contour-plot-data-function-tibco-spotfire)
- [Voronoi Polygons](https://community.tibco.com/modules/voronoi-polygons-tibco-spotfire)
- [Points-in-Polygons](https://community.tibco.com/modules/points-polygons-data-function-tibco-spotfire)

Shapefiles:
- Download [Alberta Natural Regions and Subregions Shapefile](https://www.albertaparks.ca/media/429607/natural_regions_subregions_of_alberta.zip) (Alberta Parks -- www.albertaparks.ca)
- Download [Alberta Play Outline Shapefile](https://www.aer.ca/documents/catalog/PlayWorkbookListArea.zip) (Alberta Energy Regulator -- www.aer.ca)


### Exercise 2: Machine Learning

- This DXP file may be used to demonstrate how to create a regression model in Spotfire without writing any code.
  - To demonstrate this, go to Tools > Regression Modeling, and select:
    - Response column: Production at 12 Months (BOE)
	- Predictor columns: all the other columns except Latitude and Longitude
  - Then click OK and review the output.
  - Enlarge the variable importance plot to show which columns are predictive of Production at 12 Months (BOE)

### Exercise 3: Styling Tips

Styling visualizations and dashboards is not just for aesthetics, it's for _communication_. Clearly assembled visualizations help communicate insights
